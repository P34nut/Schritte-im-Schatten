1
00:00:00,352 --> 00:00:03,610
I let him go through
what you did with my brother.

2
00:00:05,156 --> 00:00:06,156
You used him

3
00:00:07,098 --> 00:00:08,973
and finally in cold blood shot him dead.

4
00:00:13,451 --> 00:00:14,451
Yes

5
00:00:23,438 --> 00:00:24,438
you`re right there.

6
00:00:26,836 --> 00:00:28,320
I shot him dead.

7
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,438
Why?

8
00:00:32,545 --> 00:00:34,628
Why did ou do it?

9
00:00:36,094 --> 00:00:39,192
He was your informer. He was your friend.

10
00:00:40,914 --> 00:00:43,063
He treated you like his brother.

11
00:00:43,063 --> 00:00:46,773
I had no other choice.
The Tredici were threatening me.

12
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,382
I had to make a choice.

13
00:00:51,904 --> 00:00:55,029
It was my life or his.

14
00:00:56,197 --> 00:00:58,180
You cowardly rat! You shot him

15
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,409
just to rescue your own valueless arse.

16
00:01:01,434 --> 00:01:06,225
Then you fixed it so that the investigations
broke down in order to get yourself out of it all.

17
00:01:08,453 --> 00:01:09,453
You`re right.

18
00:01:10,523 --> 00:01:12,085
I was weak.

19
00:01:13,414 --> 00:01:16,265
Because of that I gave up my life.
