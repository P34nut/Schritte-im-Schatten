00:00:02,039 --> 00:00:03,335
Who are you?

2
00:00:06,816 --> 00:00:07,844
And what do you want?

3
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:13,132

I haven`t broken in.

My name is Elena Böhm
form the Daily News.

5
00:00:17,011 --> 00:00:19,472
I wanted to speak to you,

00:00:19,648 --> 00:00:22,031

00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:28,964

However I will not answer
any questions you might ask.

10
00:00:34,427 --> 00:00:36,640
Leave my house at once.

11
00:00:39,036 --> 00:00:40,651
Ms. Böhm:

12
00:00:42,344 --> 00:00:44,479
Were you in my cellar?

13
00:00:45,859 --> 00:00:47,617
So... I...
