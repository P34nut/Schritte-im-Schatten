1
00:00:03,273 --> 00:00:04,273
You must be Rene.

2
00:00:04,804 --> 00:00:05,398
Mr. Obermeier.

3
00:00:05,398 --> 00:00:06,687
Pleased to meet you.

4
00:00:08,164 --> 00:00:10,406
Please tell me what happened to Lars.

5
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:14,921
I found him in an old warehouse.

6
00:00:15,378 --> 00:00:16,445
He had been shot dead.

7
00:00:22,852 --> 00:00:24,203
Shot dead?

8
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,726
Who would do such a thing?

9
00:00:32,004 --> 00:00:33,886
Those are questions that
I have often asked myself.

10
00:00:35,052 --> 00:00:37,604
Will you help me to answer them?

11
00:00:39,609 --> 00:00:42,265
I will do all I can to ensure
the murderer is punished.

12
00:00:44,781 --> 00:00:46,369
Have the police been informed?

13
00:00:47,555 --> 00:00:49,586
No. They would be a hindrance.

14
00:00:50,445 --> 00:00:51,591
Did Lars have any enemies?

15
00:00:55,549 --> 00:00:57,607
Not that I know of.

16
00:00:58,283 --> 00:01:00,367
Did he have contacts to drug dealers?

17
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,893
Yes indeed. He took drugs.

18
00:01:09,586 --> 00:01:12,945
Bought them from a dealer
active near the market place.

19
00:01:14,273 --> 00:01:17,841
That`s what I thought.
Thank you, you`ve been a greathelp.

20
00:01:20,107 --> 00:01:22,320
As soon as I know more
I `ll get in touch with you.
