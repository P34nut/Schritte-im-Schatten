1
00:00:00,227 --> 00:00:01,562
You can`t get him out of your mind.

2
00:00:01,972 --> 00:00:04,796
Forget him.
There are thousands of other men.

3
00:00:06,227 --> 00:00:07,953
He cheated me.

4
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:12,429
With another man. And you expect from me
that I will should be able to trust another man?

5
00:00:12,861 --> 00:00:14,415
I thought I knew who what he was like.

6
00:00:20,434 --> 00:00:23,949
In three weeks we have planned
a special on unsolved murder mysteries.

7
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:26,918
See what you can do.
Maybe you can write a really good article.

8
00:00:26,918 --> 00:00:28,891
I think there is a great chance.

9
00:00:28,891 --> 00:00:30,824
I`ll start rightaway.
