1
00:00:00,852 --> 00:00:02,210
When did you kill Lars?

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,765
I`ve no idea what you`re talking about.

3
00:00:04,266 --> 00:00:06,359
Don`t pretend to be ignorant,
you sold him drugs.

4
00:00:07,125 --> 00:00:08,796
I swear I know nobody called Lars.

5
00:00:09,078 --> 00:00:10,414
You really like being hurt?

6
00:00:10,617 --> 00:00:12,294
No. I am speaking the truth.

7
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:13,505
I know nobody called Lars.

8
00:00:13,691 --> 00:00:15,927
Edgar Obermeier thinks differently.

9
00:00:16,221 --> 00:00:18,404
Obermeier? I know no Obermeier.

10
00:00:18,616 --> 00:00:20,796
But if I hear anything from one
I will let you know.

11
00:00:20,906 --> 00:00:22,265
Why should you do that?

12
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,878
If he betrays me to you, he could
also give me away to the police.

13
00:00:37,382 --> 00:00:38,906
You're Rene Kamp?

14
00:00:41,484 --> 00:00:42,484
Yes I am.

15
00:00:43,828 --> 00:00:45,742
Thank you for not arresting me.

16
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,804
I`ll let you go this time.
But next time you`ll be locked up.

17
00:00:50,586 --> 00:00:51,992
I`ve got it.

18
00:00:56,172 --> 00:00:57,382
Wait a minute.

19
00:00:59,844 --> 00:01:02,578
The drug dealer Daniel Engels who you…
- Quiet!

20
00:01:03,632 --> 00:01:07,132
I just wanted to say that his brother
Oscar Engels was with me a while ago

21
00:01:07,445 --> 00:01:09,632
 and questioned me about you and Daniel.

22
00:01:10,648 --> 00:01:13,617
Stop. I know enough.

23
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,554
<i>Hello?</i>

24
00:01:24,633 --> 00:01:27,536
Hello Mr. Obermeier. I understand.

25
00:01:27,641 --> 00:01:30,296
<i>Understand? Have you caught the murderer?</i>

26
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:33,213
Meet me at the warehouse in two hours
and I`ll explain everthing to you then.

27
00:01:33,812 --> 00:01:36,078
<i>Right, I`m on my way.</i>

28
00:01:36,286 --> 00:01:37,286
See you soon.
