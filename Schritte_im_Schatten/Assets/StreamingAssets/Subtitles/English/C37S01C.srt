1
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:06,004
Why Lars?

2
00:00:06,685 --> 00:00:08,013
What had he done?

3
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:14,898
You should go through what I went through.

4
00:00:17,656 --> 00:00:19,518
It wasn`t easy to find your brother.

5
00:00:20,547 --> 00:00:24,281
Nobody had really heard much from him

6
00:00:25,351 --> 00:00:27,773
after your mother left your father

7
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,195
and took him with her to Sweden.

8
00:00:33,081 --> 00:00:34,617
But I found him

9
00:00:36,454 --> 00:00:38,133
and got him working for me.

10
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,572
Then I killed him.

11
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,309
You are a dirty killer.

12
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,018
Don`t call me a murder!

13
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:54,887
Your brother was first,

14
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,523
now its your turn.
