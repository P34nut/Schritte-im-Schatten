1
00:00:20,469 --> 00:00:23,438
What`s up with you Mr. Kamp?

2
00:00:23,438 --> 00:00:26,484
Stop playing with me Oscar.

3
00:00:33,568 --> 00:00:36,458
I see you are not as stupid as I thought.

4
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:40,156
Who is this Lars?

5
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:44,453
You`ve known that for ages

6
00:00:45,865 --> 00:00:47,765
but you don`t want to accept it.

7
00:00:49,953 --> 00:00:51,307
But I can tell you,

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,874
it's him.

9
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:08,130
You killed him! You killed my brother!

10
00:01:08,755 --> 00:01:09,953
Yes I did.

11
00:01:10,838 --> 00:01:12,166
He really wined

12
00:01:12,922 --> 00:01:14,223
and suffered,

13
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:17,895
but I showed him no mercy.
