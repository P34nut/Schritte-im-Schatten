1
00:00:01,375 --> 00:00:05,288
I am very sorry.

2
00:00:05,313 --> 00:00:07,250
That`s no problem. Goodbye.

3
00:00:12,695 --> 00:00:16,966
I`m going slowly bananas.
Every tip is leading into a cul-de-sac.

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,833
It is as if nobody is able to tell me anything
about this unsoved murder.

5
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:29,140
She died near here. Maybe there
is a written obituary somewhere.

6
00:00:47,695 --> 00:00:48,695
Bingo!

7
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:50,705
Gudrun Engels…

8
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:55,106
your Oscar is grieving for you.

9
00:00:55,654 --> 00:00:58,856
Oscar Engels. Husband?

10
00:00:59,297 --> 00:01:01,171
Or maybe a second son?
