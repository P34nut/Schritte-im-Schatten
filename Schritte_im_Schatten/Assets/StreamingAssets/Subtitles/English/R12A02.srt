00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,607
My dear brother Daniel.

2
00:00:06,424 --> 00:00:08,880
I knew that something
like this would happen.

3
00:00:09,878 --> 00:00:12,152
You always went your own way,

4
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:14,548
even if it was the wrong one.

5
00:00:15,332 --> 00:00:17,715
 I know you did it for my mother and I.

6
00:00:17,715 --> 00:00:21,503
Nevertheless I wish I could have somehow
stopped you in doing that.

7
00:00:22,344 --> 00:00:25,488
I hope your murder
will be brought to justice.

8
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:29,121
Even if that does not bring you back

9
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,816
it would help me to get a sense of closure.

10
00:00:32,676 --> 00:00:35,494
Even if it is just a drop in a bucket

11
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,401
I know we will meet again one day.

12
00:00:40,104 --> 00:00:41,562
Your Oscar.

13
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:45,546
His brother must have meant a lot to him.

14
00:00:46,617 --> 00:00:49,742
Though it sounds like his vest
was not entirely clean either.

15
00:00:50,888 --> 00:00:52,684
At last I am making some progress!
